# ToDoApp
 I used the Python language and Django framework to create a ToDoApp. This webpage provides the user a form to input all the items that need to be done. The items get added to a database and also show on the website as a list. Items can be marked as completed. The completed items can be deleted to clearly show the remaining items that need to be done next. There is an option to also delete all the items at once.
 This project was a good practice in the Django Model Template View design pattern.
